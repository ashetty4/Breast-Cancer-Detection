# Breast-Cancer-Detection
This project uses Logistic regression, Decision  Trees and Random Forest Algorithms to detect if a patitent has Breast Cancer or not!</br>
Please note that this is my personal journey of learning to use Machine Learning in a medical domain. I am not the inventor of the code but I developed it by using tutorials and blogs online.
